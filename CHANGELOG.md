# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0]

### Added

- Maximum manifest body size enforcement.
- Warning log when a listener flips between insecure and TLS during configuration hot-reload.

### Changed

- Blob deletion follows the OCI distribution lifecycle, with blob ownership tracked independently from manifest references.
- Manifests with missing blob or descriptor references are rejected at push time.
- Stricter OCI semantics for blob range requests and request-header parsing.
- Pull-through cached blobs are indexed, so they participate in reachability checks and garbage collection.
- Upstream blob failures and 404s return `BLOB_UNKNOWN` instead of `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN`.
- OCI digest validation rejects uppercase algorithm and hex characters.
- Server errors return the OCI `INTERNAL_ERROR` code in JSON responses.
- Non-boolean CEL access-policy rule results are fail-closed in both `allow` and `deny` modes.
- Configuration is fully validated at load time (URLs, Redis cache URLs, Argon2 hashes, CEL rules, sampling rates, webhook refs, regexes, listener timeouts); invalid values now fail at startup with a clear error instead of later at runtime.
- OIDC providers are tried in deterministic order, and the `mTLS` `auth_method` label is preserved when basic auth also succeeds.
- Auth-webhook transport failures surface as errors instead of silent denials.
- Webhook retries are capped at 16 with saturating backoff arithmetic.
- The S3 shard-key hash uses SHA-256, so shard placement is stable across processes and builds.
- Filesystem metadata now uses the same sharded blob-index and namespace-registry layout as S3, and scrub migrates legacy filesystem and S3 metadata files to the sharded layout.
- The Redis client reuses a multiplexed connection across operations and backs off on lock contention.
- The S3 backend now uses a custom HTTP client in place of the AWS SDK: focused retry / timeout / signing tailored to the operations the registry actually issues, smaller binary, and no AWS SDK transitive dependencies.
- Filesystem cleanup of empty ancestor directories is depth-bounded (2 levels for blob shards, 3 for index and namespace-registry shards, 4 for link containers) and rooted-subtree guarded; a misshaped path can never walk above the configured root.
- UI, documentation-website and Rust dependencies upgraded.

#### Performance

- Uniform S3 multipart uploads are streamed end-to-end; large-blob copies use S3 multipart copy.
- Blob-index lock contention reduced; ownership checks and GC cleanup no longer read the full index, and redundant writes are skipped.
- Filesystem metadata link locks now include namespace, reducing unrelated repository contention while blob-index locks stay digest-global across metadata backends.
- Existing blob data is reused on upload completion; empty / zero-byte rewrites are skipped on both uniform and nonuniform paths.
- Lower per-frame overhead in upload streaming.

### Deprecated

- The boolean `default_allow` flag is now an alias for the typed `AccessMode` setting and will be removed in a future release.
- The `cache_store` and `storage` configuration keys are legacy aliases.

### Removed

- Deprecated fields removed from `config.example.toml`.

### Fixed

- Hardened S3 uploads and blob-index locking against contention and partial-failure scenarios.
- Failed upload cleanups no longer abort the client request; orphaned S3 probe objects are surfaced via warning instead of silently leaking.
- Multipart uploads and parts are aborted on drop or panic, so failed uploads don't leave orphans on S3.
- Repository initialization no longer blocks the async runtime, fixing startup stalls on registries with many repositories.
- Upstream bearer tokens: per-upstream cache scope, serialized refreshes, TTL cache, and URL-encoded query parameters.
- The registry client fails with a clear error on missing upstream host authority instead of falling back to an `"unknown"` cache key.
- `rustls` is initialized before custom CA bundles, so configured roots are honored. The `TlsAcceptor` is cloned out of its `ArcSwap` guard before the handshake, fixing a race during certificate hot-reload.
- Shutdown logs `SIGTERM` registration failures (falling back to ctrl-c) and shuts the tracer provider down gracefully.
- Registry-initialization errors are preserved and surfaced to the operator.
- Error responses no longer panic the handler; a 500 is always produced.
- A poisoned capability-cache mutex is recovered from instead of crashing.
- Circuit-breaker race fixed: the breaker no longer occasionally stays open after recovery.
- Authentication: invalid basic credentials rejected, OIDC algorithm allowlist enforced, missing OIDC claims return `Unauthorized`, OIDC fetch failures return 503, JWKs refresh on unknown `kid`, and webhook auth configs validated at construction.
- Webhook async deliveries abort cleanly on shutdown timeout.
- Valkey `contrib/kubernetes` manifest: corrected an inverted `securityContext`.
- Documentation: fixed read-only example snippets.

### Security

- Webhook, S3 and basic-auth secrets wrapped in a `Secret` type to prevent leaks via debug logging.
- OIDC claims redacted from authorization-denial logs; webhook cache keys hashed.
- Argon2id parameters pinned explicitly to OWASP-recommended values.
- Several dependency vulnerabilities addressed.
