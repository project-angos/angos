# Upgrade Angos

This guide covers breaking configuration changes introduced across releases and the steps needed to migrate an existing deployment.

---

## 1.0.x → 1.1.0

### Redis Lock Configuration (Breaking Change)

#### What Changed

The Redis lock table has moved from `[metadata_store.*.redis]` to `[metadata_store.*.lock_strategy.redis]`.

**Who is affected:** Only deployments that explicitly configured Redis distributed locking. If you are using the default in-memory lock strategy (i.e., your configuration does not contain a `[metadata_store.*.redis]` table), no action is required.

The old form is still accepted for backward compatibility but is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

#### Migrate a Filesystem Metadata Store

**Before:**

```toml
[metadata_store.fs]
root_dir = "/data/metadata"

[metadata_store.fs.redis]
url = "redis://localhost:6379"
ttl = 10
key_prefix = "locks"
```

**After:**

```toml
[metadata_store.fs]
root_dir = "/data/metadata"

[metadata_store.fs.lock_strategy.redis]
url = "redis://localhost:6379"
ttl = 10
key_prefix = "locks"
```

#### Migrate an S3 Metadata Store

**Before:**

```toml
[metadata_store.s3]
bucket = "my-registry-meta"
region = "us-east-1"

[metadata_store.s3.redis]
url = "redis://localhost:6379"
ttl = 10
```

**After:**

```toml
[metadata_store.s3]
bucket = "my-registry-meta"
region = "us-east-1"

[metadata_store.s3.lock_strategy.redis]
url = "redis://localhost:6379"
ttl = 10
```

Rename the section header in your configuration file and restart the registry. No data migration is required.

### New Features Available in 1.1.0

#### S3-Native Distributed Locking

S3 metadata store deployments can now use S3 conditional writes for distributed locking instead of Redis, eliminating the need for a separate Redis instance:

```toml
[metadata_store.s3.lock_strategy.s3]
ttl_secs = 30
```

See [Distributed Locking](../reference/configuration.md#distributed-locking) in the configuration reference for full options and tuning guidance.

#### S3 Capabilities Declaration

You can declare your S3 provider's conditional operation support upfront to skip the startup probe and enable performance optimizations:

```toml
[metadata_store.s3.capabilities]
put_if_none_match = true
put_if_match = true
delete_if_match = true
```

See [Conditional Capabilities](../reference/configuration.md#conditional-capabilities-metadata_stores3capabilities) in the configuration reference for details on when to use this and which providers support each capability.

## 1.1.x → Next

### Redirect Configuration Split

#### What Changed

`global.enable_redirect` has been deprecated and replaced by two separate flags:

- `global.enable_blob_redirect` — controls HTTP 307 redirects for blob (layer/config) downloads.
- `global.enable_manifest_redirect` — controls HTTP 307 redirects for manifest downloads.

Both default to `true`, preserving historical behavior. The old `enable_redirect` field is still accepted as a fallback for both new flags and will emit a deprecation warning at startup.

Additionally, presigned manifest URLs now include a `response-content-type` query parameter so that S3 serves the correct OCI/Docker media type after a redirect, rather than `binary/octet-stream`. This fixes `podman pull` and `skopeo copy` failures against Angos deployments with S3-backed storage and redirects enabled.

#### Migration

**If you had `enable_redirect = false` as a workaround for Podman/Skopeo manifest parsing errors**, you can now enable redirects:

```toml
[global]
enable_blob_redirect = true
enable_manifest_redirect = true
```

Or simply remove the `enable_redirect = false` line, since the default for both new flags is `true`.

**If you want to keep redirects disabled**:

```toml
[global]
enable_blob_redirect = false
enable_manifest_redirect = false
```

**If you want to keep using `enable_redirect`**, no immediate action is required. The field continues to work as a fallback but will print a warning at startup. Update to the new fields at your convenience.
